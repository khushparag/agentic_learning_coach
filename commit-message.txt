fix(demo): Correct API port configuration and enhance cross-platform compatibility in hackathon demo script

This commit addresses critical configuration inconsistencies and platform compatibility issues in the enhanced hackathon demonstration script that were preventing successful demo execution across different environments.

## Primary Changes

### Port Configuration Corrections (8000 → 8002)
- **Line 10**: Updated health check endpoint from `http://localhost:8000/health/detailed` to `http://localhost:8002/health/detailed`
- **Line 22**: Corrected Swagger UI documentation URL from `http://localhost:8000/docs` to `http://localhost:8002/docs`
- **Line 66**: Fixed health check command in demo timeline from `curl -s http://localhost:8000/health/detailed | jq` to `curl -s http://localhost:8002/health/detailed | jq`
- **Line 98**: Updated orchestrator agent routing endpoint from `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/orchestrator/route` to `http://localhost:8002/api/v1/agents/orchestrator/route`
- **Line 108**: Corrected curriculum creation endpoint from `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/curriculum/create` to `http://localhost:8002/api/v1/curriculum/create`
- **Line 118**: Fixed code submission endpoint from `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/submissions/submit` to `http://localhost:8002/api/v1/submissions/submit`
- **Line 175**: Updated automated health check script from `curl -s http://localhost:8000/health/detailed | jq '.status'` to `curl -s http://localhost:8002/health/detailed | jq '.status'`
- **Line 181**: Corrected skill assessment API call from `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/orchestrator/route` to `http://localhost:8002/api/v1/agents/orchestrator/route`
- **Line 185**: Fixed curriculum creation API call from `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/curriculum/create` to `http://localhost:8002/api/v1/curriculum/create`
- **Line 189**: Updated code submission API call from `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/submissions/submit` to `http://localhost:8002/api/v1/submissions/submit`

### Development Server Configuration Optimization
- **Lines 10-13**: Removed redundant frontend development server startup commands (`cd frontend && npm run dev & cd ..`) from the setup section
- This change eliminates potential race conditions and port conflicts during demo setup
- The frontend server is now expected to be started independently, providing better control over the demo environment

### Cross-Platform Compatibility Enhancement
- **Line 25**: Added Windows batch file reference `# Or on Windows: scripts\demo-test.bat` alongside the existing Unix shell script reference
- This addition ensures that Windows users have clear guidance on executing the demo test script using the appropriate platform-specific command
- Maintains backward compatibility while extending support to Windows development environments

## Technical Impact Analysis

### Port Standardization Benefits
The port correction from 8000 to 8002 aligns the demo script with the actual FastAPI service configuration as defined in the docker-compose.yml and application settings. This change:
- Eliminates connection failures during live demonstrations
- Ensures consistency between documentation and actual service endpoints
- Prevents confusion for developers following the demo script
- Aligns with the production deployment configuration where the API service runs on port 8002

### Development Workflow Improvements
The removal of automatic frontend server startup provides several advantages:
- Reduces complexity in the demo setup process
- Eliminates potential port conflicts between services
- Allows for better error handling and debugging during demo preparation
- Provides presenters with more control over the timing of service initialization
- Reduces the risk of race conditions between backend and frontend service startup

### Platform Inclusivity Enhancement
The addition of Windows-specific command references:
- Expands the accessibility of the demo to Windows-based development environments
- Provides clear guidance for cross-platform demo execution
- Maintains consistency with the project's cross-platform development approach
- Reduces barriers to entry for Windows developers participating in hackathons or demonstrations

## Quality Assurance Considerations

### Endpoint Consistency Verification
All API endpoint references have been systematically updated to ensure:
- Consistent port usage across all curl commands
- Proper alignment with the actual service configuration
- Elimination of potential 404 errors during live demonstrations
- Maintenance of the complete API workflow demonstration

### Demo Script Reliability
These changes significantly improve the reliability of the demo script by:
- Ensuring all HTTP requests target the correct service endpoints
- Reducing the likelihood of connection timeouts or failures
- Providing clear platform-specific execution instructions
- Maintaining the logical flow of the demonstration while fixing technical issues

## Backward Compatibility Assessment

### Configuration Changes
The port changes are breaking changes for environments that may have been configured to use port 8000, but this is necessary to align with the correct service configuration. The changes:
- Reflect the actual production configuration
- Maintain consistency with docker-compose service definitions
- Ensure compatibility with the current application architecture

### Script Execution Compatibility
The removal of automatic frontend startup maintains compatibility with existing demo procedures while:
- Providing more explicit control over service initialization
- Reducing potential conflicts with existing development server instances
- Allowing for better error handling and troubleshooting during demos

## Testing and Validation Requirements

### Pre-Demo Verification Steps
These changes require validation of:
- FastAPI service accessibility on port 8002
- Swagger UI availability at the corrected endpoint
- Successful execution of all curl commands with updated endpoints
- Cross-platform compatibility of the demo-test script references

### Integration Testing Considerations
The updated endpoints should be verified against:
- The actual docker-compose service configuration
- The FastAPI application routing configuration
- The health check endpoint implementation
- The API versioning and routing structure

This commit ensures that the enhanced hackathon demo script accurately reflects the current system configuration while improving cross-platform compatibility and reducing potential points of failure during live demonstrations.
