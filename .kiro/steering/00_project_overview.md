# Project Overview: Agentic Learning Coach for Developers

## Product Summary
An intelligent multi-agent system that provides personalized coding education and mentorship for developers. The system adapts to individual learning styles, tracks progress, and delivers targeted exercises with real-time feedback.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Adaptive Learning**: AI-driven curriculum that adjusts to learner pace and skill level
- **Practice-First Approach**: Hands-on coding exercises with immediate feedback
- **Multi-Agent Intelligence**: Specialized agents for different aspects of learning
- **Developer-Focused**: Real-world coding scenarios and industry best practices
